*when trying to work with a flutter project in a github repo on mulitple machines I end up in a sort of dependency hell where one machine can't recognize the dart

*that are pretty much static in your app. The only thing that will need to be kept track of are dependencies and they will be listed below*

### Dependencies (*if any*)
